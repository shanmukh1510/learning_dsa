today the leetcode problem a bit easy ,its just to find the binaary number consists of how many 1's and that 1's count is prime or not.
and that should br returned.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def countPrimeSetBits(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:  
        def is_prime(n):
            if n < 2:
                return False
            for j in range(2, n):
                if n % j == 0:
                    return False
            return True 
        result = 0  
        for i in range(left, right+1):
            count_1 = 0
            temp = i 
            while temp > 0:
                if temp % 2 == 1:
                    count_1 += 1
                temp = temp // 2  
            if is_prime(count_1):
                result += 1
        return result
