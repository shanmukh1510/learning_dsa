in this i have learned how to use hashset and when to use.
mainky hashset is used for not having the duplicates in the set.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        Set = set()
        for i in range(len(s)-k+1):
            Set.add(s[i: i+k])
        if len(Set) == 2**k:
            return True
        else:
            return False
its a very optimized output in my way
