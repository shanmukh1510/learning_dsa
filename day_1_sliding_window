AS I NOTICED THAT ,IT IS USED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT INVOLVE SUBARRAY OR SUBSTRING OR WINDOWS.

INSTEAD OF REPEATEDLY ITERATING OVER THE SAME ELEMENT OVER THE SAME ELEMENT THE SLIDING WINDOW MAINTAINS A RANGE THET MOVES STEP BY STEP THROUGH DATA,UPDATING RESULTS INCREMENTALLY.

CODE:
   CLass solution:
     def maxSubarraySum(self,arr,k):
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
          s = s + arr[i]
              OR
        s = sum(arr[:k])
        max_s = s
        for i in range(1,len(arr)-k+1):
          s = s + arr[i+k-1] - arr[i-1]
          if s > max_s:
            max_s = s
        return max_s

input_1: arr[] = [5,2,-1,0,3],k=3
          output = 6
input_2: arr[] = [1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,20],k=4
          output = 39
