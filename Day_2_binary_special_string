i have learned about the special binary string problem in the leetcode
conditions:
1.the no of 0's and 1's should be equal
2.every string or pranthesis should start with 1.

code:
 class Solution:
    def makeLargestSpecial(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = 0
        start = 0
        new = []
        for j,char in enumerate(s):
            if char == '1':
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            
            if count == 0:
                middle_part = self.makeLargestSpecial(s[start+1:j]) //recursive part of whole problem
                new.append("1"+ middle_part +"0")
                start = j+1
        new.sort(reverse = True)
        return "".join(new)

explanation:
1.at first it checks the equal no of 1's and 0's 
2.and then it checks recursively the middle_part and append to the new list.
3.the sort the new list and join it
