there are so many approaches but i got the optimal solution by counting the 1's in the number.
if the number of are equal then i need to check the number.
in this code:
 i learned how to use lambda function and also how to use in the function like sort(),etc
 syntax: arr.sort(key = lambda variables:condition)

CODE:
class Solution:
    def sortByBits(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        arr.sort(key = lambda num:(num.bit_count(),num))
        return arr
