In this problem i mainly learned the recursion of the function.
i have done using left recursion for calculation.
as we are going left or right we multiply with the 2 to the val in the code and adding to the root.val.

  
CODE:
  # Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumRootToLeaf(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def solve(root,val):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            val = (2*val) + root.val
            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                return val
            return solve(root.left,val) + solve(root.right,val)
        
        return solve(root,0)
