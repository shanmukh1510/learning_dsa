its a bit easy today but i havent think about the optimal solution when i come back to it i find thge optimal solution to it.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        num = j = count = 0
        i = len(s) - 1
        while i >= 0:
            num += int(s[i])*(2**j)
            i -= 1
            j += 1
        while num > 1:
            if num%2 != 0:
                num = num + 1
                count += 1
            elif num%2 == 0:
                num = num//2
                count += 1
        return count
